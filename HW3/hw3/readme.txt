I found this assignment being difficult because the gradescope uses hidden input. It is also difficult 
because one question contains lots of sub-questions. It will be more helpful if they are listed as subquestions. 
I also misunderstand questions sometimes, I hope the questions will be clearer. But at the same time, I should
improve my English language skill.
