/**********************************************************************
 *  What is the relationship between the number of steps n of the
 *  random walk and the mean squared distance? By relationship, we mean
 *  something like
 *                       mean squared distance = 126 n^9
 *
 *  Briefly justify your answer based on computational experiments.
 *  Describe the experiments and list several data points.
 *********************************************************************/
I conducted some experiments to test the relationship between the number of steps n and the mean squared distance.
I found that the relationship between n and the mean sqaured distance was nearly equal to each other.
Specificaly, mean squared distance = n. I computed 1.2 as the average of all the values in column mean dist / n, and 1.2 is approximately 1.
